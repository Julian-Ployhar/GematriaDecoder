# GematriaDecoder
An alpha-numerical cipher system used to analyze the Torah

This program is centered around the arranging and decoding of Gematria!
Gematria is a numerical system that equates letter values to numerical ones.

For example, in simple gematria:
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3

Therefore, "Angel" can be broken down into:
--> A [1] n [14] g [7] e [5] l [12] = [39]
This, in the context of the Torah, involves reading the individual value of Hebrew letters and finding numerical synchronicities within the Torah.
When expanding to other languages, such as Koine Greek, gematria can expand to the New Testament as well.
